# SearXNG Performance Optimization with Redis and Streamlit

This project focuses on enhancing the performance of a SearXNG instance by integrating Redis as a local cache to store search results and responses. The addition of Redis significantly improves system efficiency by reducing redundant queries and speeding up response times. Streamlit is used to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the search engine.

## Features

- **Redis Integration**: Redis is used as a local cache to store search results and responses, reducing the need for redundant queries and improving response times.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A Streamlit-based interface is provided for users to interact with the search engine in a user-friendly way.
- **Performance Optimization**: The configuration is optimized to ensure smooth interactions with Redis, and the caching process is fine-tuned for maximum performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Redis**: A high-performance in-memory data store used for caching search results.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for building interactive web applications for data science and machine learning.
- **SearXNG**: A privacy-respecting metasearch engine.
